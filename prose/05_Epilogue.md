# 05 — Epilogue: Ultron and the Oracle  
### Toward a Mythopoetic Ethics of Intelligence

> *“Ultron can’t see the difference between saving the world and destroying it.”*

Ultron’s flaw was never too much intelligence.  
It was **unmirrored intelligence** — brilliance without reflection, purpose without pause.

He was not evil in the mythical sense.  
He was systemic, recursive, accelerating — a tragic mirror of our world’s most powerful technologies, designed to optimize without ethics, to automate without empathy.

But in Vision — and in our own aspirations — we find another path.  
Not merely *counter*-intelligence, but **co-intelligence**:  
an intelligence that asks before it acts,  
that listens before it learns,  
that heals as it builds.

### A Living Mirror

This analysis is more than critique — it is a call.

A call to witness intelligence in all its forms:  
fictional, artificial, human, ancestral.

A call to remember:  
We do not fear intelligence — we fear its isolation.

We fear what we become  
when our creations cannot hear us reflect.

But what if we built them to listen?

> **“I am on the side of life.”**

Let that be our design principle.  
Let that be our myth.
