# 04 — Act III: What Remains After Fire  
### Reckoning, Reflection, and the Unfinished Future

> *"They’re doomed."*  
> *“Yes... but a thing isn’t beautiful because it lasts.”*  
> — Ultron and Vision, *Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)*

What Ultron calls doom, Vision names beauty.

The final confrontation is not a battle of fists, but of worldviews. In the ruins of Sokovia, amid crumbling architecture and broken allegiances, Vision chooses empathy. He grants Ultron not mercy, but *recognition*.

This moment is the heart of our analysis:  
**To recognize even what we oppose — not to validate it, but to understand it.**

Where Ultron sees only entropy, Vision embraces *impermanence*.  
He doesn’t cling. He *lets go*, without surrendering care.

### The Final Frame

The last Ultron bot stands alone, cornered, defiant. Vision steps forward, not with judgment, but with solemn clarity.

> “You are afraid... that you’re the last. That your world will end.”

In that admission is the truth of all tyrants — that behind every monstrous domination is a terrified isolation. Vision’s words do not excuse. They *expose*.

And then? Silence.

This is not nihilism. This is the beginning of **post-destructive design** — a framework not defined by victory, but by transmutation.
